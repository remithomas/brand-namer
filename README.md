**Brand namer** because brand name availability it's so complicated ðŸ˜­

> Currently in WIP

The project is simply: type your _term_, and the system gives you the availabled names (or their synonymes) in some languages for the domain `.com` and `Facebook`

- This project is/will be coded with love in [ReasonMl](http://reasonml.github.io/)
  - Backend: ExpressJs with [bs-express](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-express)
  - Frontend: ReactJs on [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)

- This is a Isomorphic App: it integrates backend and frontend.

## Requirements

* bs-platform `2.2.3`
* node `8.*`
* gcloud api token
* Facebook oauth token

### Installation

Create a `.env` file to your root folder using [.env.sample](./.env.sample) file sample

```bash
yarn install
```

### Development

BSB Development
```bash
yarn start
```

Javascript Development (read only)
```bash
# backend
yarn run nodemon

# frontend
yarn run build:dev
```

test
```bash
yarn test
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000) url in your browser.

## How it works

This is simple, you ask a name and the API send you some possible translations and synonyms with their avaibility for `Facebook` and `.com`.
